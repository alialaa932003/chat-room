## Future improvements

Future Improvements
If I have more time, I plan to implement the following features to enhance the functionality of the chat application:

-   **User Search:** Add a feature to search through the user list.
-   **Collapsed Sidebar:** Collapsing the sidebar would help maximize the chat interface's space, especially on smaller screens, providing a cleaner and more focused chatting experience.
-   **Advanced Features:** Include features like message notifications, typing indicators, and user presence status.
